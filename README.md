# Disciple Tools - Streams

A stream is a collection of work, large or small. The streams plugin interconnects leaders, disciples, groups, churches, trainings, and other elements with census style reporting. A stream can be a large organization, movement, or a few groups started from a single training. It is a named effort that needs to be tracked for good stewardship.
