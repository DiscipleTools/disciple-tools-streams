# Disciple Tools - Streams

A stream is a collection of work, large or small. The streams plugin interconnects leaders, disciples, 
groups, churches, trainings, and other elements with census style reporting. A stream can be a large 
organization, movement, or a few groups started from a single training. It is a named effort that needs 
to be tracked for good stewardship.

## Purpose

The movement of the kingdom is not clean and organized. Streams is an effort to provide a container that 
allows a disciple maker to track area of work which might be a collection of leaders, trainings, and groups.
Often the reporting from these efforts can lack detail, so the census reporting allows those leaders and key
disciples to report on the numbers of baptisms and groups with locations. 

Organizing collections of work this way, allows leaders to go to one place and understand key leadership,
key groups/churches, and key training efforts in those areas.

## Usage
